This is docker-lineage-cicd with a hack to make it apply some patches for S4 mini value editon before building.
That is, it is only capable of building this one device (and branch 14.1) now.
Just run build-example.sh to build or edit it to customize your build.
For documentation, check upstream, or just read Dockerfile, build.sh and init.sh.
